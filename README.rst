Deploying
=========

The Open edX Filters component is a Python library which doesn't
need independent deployment. Therefore, its setup is reasonably
straightforward. First, it needs to be added to your service
requirements, and then it will be installed alongside requirements
of the service.

If the service you intend to use is either the LMS or CMS, then
the library is installed alongside their requirements since the
Nutmeg release.
