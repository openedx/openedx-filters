Events vs Filters
=================

Open edX Events and Filters are two types of hooks that allow developers to extend the functionality of the Open edX platform. They are defined in the `openedx-events`_ and `openedx-filters`_ libraries respectively.

Events
------

Events are Open edX-specific Django signals sent in specific places in the Open edX platform. Signal handlers can then be hooked into these signals to perform additional processing based on the event data.

For a more detailed explanation of Open edX Events, see the rest of the Open edX Events documentation.

Filters
-------

Filters are functions that can modify the application's behavior by altering input data or halting execution based on specific conditions. They allow developers to implement application flow control based on their business logic or requirements without directly modifying the application code.

For a more detailed explanation of Open edX Filters, see the `Open edX Filters`_ documentation.

Differences between Events and Filters
--------------------------------------

Here are some key differences between Open edX Events and Filters:

+--------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Implementation** |  Implemented using Django signals, which allow                         |  Implemented using an accumulative pipeline mechanism which |

+--------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Example**        |  A custom event that triggers an email notification                    |  A filter that modifies the data returned by a specific     |
|                    |  when a user enrolls in a course.                                      |  API endpoint to include additional information.            |

When to use an Open edX Event?
------------------------------

Use an Open edX Event when you need to:

- Trigger custom logic or processing in response to specific actions within the platform, e.g., updating a search index after a course block is modified.
- Communicate, synchronize, or coordinate with other components or services based on specific events or actions, e.g., send certificate data from LMS to credentials service to keep models up to date.
- Integrate with external systems or services based on specific events or actions within the platform, e.g., send user data to third-party services upon registration for marketing purposes.

In summary, events can be used to integrate application components with each other or with external services, allowing them to communicate, synchronize, and perform additional actions when specific triggers occur.

When to use an Open edX Filter?
-------------------------------

Use an Open edX Filter when:

- Enrich the data or parameters passed to a specific component, e.g., fetch reusable LTI configurations from external plugins.
- Intercept and modify the input of a specific component, e.g., modify block structure so it renders additional data.
- Enforce specific constraints or business rules on the input or output of a specific function or method, e.g., prevent enrollment for non-authorized users.

In summary, filters can be used when implementing application flow control that modifies the application's behavior, navigation, or user interaction flow during runtime.
