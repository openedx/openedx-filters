class PipelineStep:
    """
    Defines each step of the pipeline to be executed by the pipeline runner.

    Example usage:

    Let's say we want a filter step that changes enrollment modes:

    1. If the enrollment mode is honor, then changes it to no-id-professional.
    2. If it's other mode, then stop pipeline execution.

    This pipeline step can be used in conjunction with PreEnrollmentFilter, that's
    why the runner method accepts user, course_key and mode as arguments.

    >>> class MyFilterStep(PipelineStep):
            def run_filter(self, user, course_key, mode):
                if mode != "honor":
                    return
                return {
                    "user": user,
                    "course_key": course_key,
                    "mode": "no-id-professional",
                }

    Another version would be:

    >>> class MyFilterStep(PipelineStep):
            def run_filter(self, user, course_key, mode):
                if mode != "honor":
                    return
                return {"mode": "no-id-professional"}

    def __init__(self, filter_type, running_pipeline, **extra_config):
        """
        Init method for PipelineStep base class.

        Arguments:
            filter_type (str): name of the filter.
            running_pipeline ([type]): list of steps currently running.
            extra_config (dict): extra configuration defined in OPEN_EDX_FILTERS_CONFIG.
